## Get Recurring Items

Use this endpoint to retrieve a list of recurring items to expect for a specified month.

A different set of recurring items is expected every month. These can be once a year, twice a year, every four months, etc.

If a recurring item is listed as “twice a month,” then the recurring item object returned will have an `occurrences` attribute populated by the different billing dates the system believes recurring transactions should occur, including the two dates in the current month, the last transaction date prior to the month, and the next transaction date after the month. 

If the recurring item is listed as “once a week,” then the recurring item object returned will have an `occurrences` object populated with as many times as there are weeks for the specified month, along with the last transaction from the previous month and the next transaction for the next month.

In the same vein, if a recurring item that began last month is set to “Every 3 months”, then that recurring item object that occurred will not include any dates for this month.
